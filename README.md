## Azure Functions Tutorial

As part of my internship at the Co-op, I got the opportunity to work alongside some developers working on serverless functions in Azure cloud. 
Since I was unfamiliar with Typescript, as part of my onboarding I took the time to learn Typescript by following the Azure functions quickstart guide.
For more info, see the guide here: 

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/create-first-function-vs-code-typescript?pivots=nodejs-model-v4

### The tutorial is split into 2 stages:
 - [Stage 1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/create-first-function-vs-code-typescript?pivots=nodejs-model-v4) - Creating your first function.
 - [Stage 2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-add-output-binding-storage-queue-vs-code?pivots=programming-language-typescript&tabs=isolated-process) - Connecting that function to a storage queue.

I then took it upon myself to expand on the tutorial function, to tweak variables and change functionality to get more familar with the Typescript syntax.
